# wireframing.
• Wireframing is creating a simple visual blueprint of a website or app, showing layout and key elements without detailed design. It helps communicate ideas, spot usability issues early, and make quick, cost-effective changes before development.
# Key Elements of a Wireframe.
- **Layout Structure:** Defines the arrangement of elements on the page, including sections, columns, and spacing.  
  *Example:* A clear header, main content area, and footer guide the user’s eye and organize information logically.
- **Navigation:** Shows menus, links, and pathways users take to move through the application.  
  *Example:* A top navigation bar with clearly labeled sections allows users to quickly find important pages.
- **Content Placement:** Specifies where text, images, buttons, and other content will appear.  
  *Example:* Placing a call-to-action button prominently near product information encourages user engagement.
- **Functionality:** Highlights interactive elements, such as forms, buttons, and dynamic features, indicating how the user will interact with the system.  
  *Example:* Including a search bar in the wireframe demonstrates where users can quickly find specific content or bookings.
# Types of Wireframes.
Low-fidelity wireframes are simple sketches used early to explore layouts and gather quick feedback, while high-fidelity wireframes are detailed, polished designs created later to validate ideas, test usability, and prepare for development.
The wireframe created in the link is a *high-fidelity wireframe*
